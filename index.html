        <p>After the scintillating success of the One Piece live-action series (review), Netflix’s next live-action
            adaptation is the Emmy-award-winning animated series, Avatar: The Last Airbender. This all-new live-action
            series is right around the corner, and it is time to take a look at the cast of Avatar: The Last Airbender
            and the characters they will be playing. Long-time fans may easily recognize these characters, but if you
            don’t remember them or are completely new to the Avatar-verse, let me take you on a tour of the cast and

        <h2>1. Gordon Cormier as “Aang”</h2>
        <p>The role Aang has seen through several cast choices over time, and it looks like Netflix has hit the gold
            mine with Gordon Cormier. The talented young actor will be taking the shape of Avatar in the brand-new
            live-action series. As the title of the show suggests, our protagonist is the last airbender who will embark
            on an adventure to save the world. Will he become the savior of this universe as prophesized? Find that out
            for yourself soon.

            Gordon Cormier is a prodigious actor who began his acting journey at the age of six. He was born in Canada
            and landed Aang’s role by working on some of Netflix’s projects such as Lost in Space, The Stand, and more.
            We highly anticipate that his performance as Aang could be a turning point in his flourishing acting life.
